# iaes

Code for an automation tool that I created for a previous employer.

It took a screenshot of a remote work session, extracted form cells
from the screenshot, and validated the form using many different
validation functions.

The form had two halves, with the top half consisting of
individual cells, while the bottom was a grid of cells. Therefore,
different validators were needed for each half.

Validator functions can be found
